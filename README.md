This is a Django website that I made as a hobby.
The way the website works is you can make groups focused on a particular theme, such as practicing a language or talking about sports, for example.  And then you can host events that pertain to that theme.  The website will make a Jitsi Meet room for you and email a reminder including the Jitsi Meet room link to all who RSVP'ed 15 minutes before the scheduled start of the event.
It took me about 1 week to make it.  The stack is Django, Vue.js, Bootstrap (css).

Yay!
